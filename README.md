# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

This script is intended to merge and clean two data sets, 'train' and 'test' that are formatted as a series of .txt files.

More specifically, the script extracts the mean and standard deviation each of these measurements, provides appropriate labels to distinguish the different sets of measurements gathered in each data set, and produces a tidy table with the average of all variables for all activities performed in the experiment for all subjects.
