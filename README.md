## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

#Introduction
This repository contains a script and codebook to merge and clean two data sets, 'train' and 'test' that are formatted as a series of .txt files. 

#Script
The script is saved to the file run_analysis.R.

The script extracts the mean and standard deviation each of these measurements, provides appropriate labels to distinguish the different sets of measurements gathered in each data set, and produces a tidy table with the average of all variables for all activities performed in the experiment for all subjects.

#Codebook
The codebook is saved to the file CodeBook.md.

The codebook names and explains all information related to variables and calculations and units of measurement used in the process of cleaning and merging the data.
